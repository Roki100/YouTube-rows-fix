# YouTube rows fix

[Userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/11245/youtube-6-rows-in-channel-videos-page)

## A simple userstyle that fixes that ugly change where only 4 rows of videos are visble on channel's video page, brings back the OG 6 rows or whatever amount you want.

### Installation & Requirements:

* First of all you need a browser extension, [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), Available here: [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) / [Firefox addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
* Once you have stylus simply head over to [Raw file contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roki100/YouTube-rows-fix/main/rowsfix.user.css) and Stylus should pop up asking you to install, thats it!

#### Feature todo list:
* Ability to customize the row count on entire youtube website, not just channel pages, but only as an optional toggle(s)
