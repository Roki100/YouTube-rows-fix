### A simple userstyle that fixes that ugly change where only 4 rows of videos are visble on channel's video page, makes row count fully customizable, also supports subscription feed and home pages

### Installation & Requirements:

* First of all you need a browser extension, [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), Available here: [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) / [Firefox addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
* Once you have stylus simply head over to [Raw file contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roki100/YouTube-rows-fix/main/rowsfix.user.css) and Stylus should pop up asking you to install, thats it!

#### Feature todo list:
* Fix home page & subscription page thumbnails to display correctly without nuking shorts

#### Known issues:
* Blocking shorts with extensions like blocktube still leaves blank space on front page & subscription feed, you have to use an userstyle blocking method in order to fill that gap, i haven't found any fix for that yet

#### Latest changelog (since 1.0.8):
- 1.1.1
  * Fixed the width of bar that includes video filtering buttons (e.g. "New to you")
- 1.1.0
  * Added very experimental userscript compatibility layer to help address [#2](https://github.com/Roki100/YouTube-rows-fix/issues/2)
- 1.0.9
  * Padding bugfix
- 1.0.8:
  * Implement fullscreen width grid feature, (Related: [#1](https://github.com/Roki100/YouTube-rows-fix/issues/1))

###### Big thanks to:
[jiraph](https://github.com/jiraph) (doesn't use github) - For every help with the project, He has helped to solve a math problem with width calculation and he is the creator of thumbnail size customization feature!

[sapondanaisriwan](https://github.com/sapondanaisriwan) - For [fullscreen width grid code](https://github.com/Roki100/YouTube-rows-fix/issues/1#issuecomment-1666367171), It was a feature requested by 2 people so i decided to "yoink" it into the userstyle :P
